  description: I am surprised that he has given me a pencil to write with, after the
    many, many times that i have tried to attack him, giving me a sharp pointed object
    wasnt so smart. If it wasn't for the gas he pumps into the room before he enters
    i would of stabbed him in the back or neck already and make my escape. Where would
    i go, i don't know just freedom would be nice to be able to see the sky one last
    time, would be nice to see more than 4 walls, anything would be better than this.

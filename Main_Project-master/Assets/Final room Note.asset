  description: "Doctor Andersons log  Date (unknown) \u201CLost track\u201D  Log:
    204    I have failed, after 4 years of testing and hard work. All my patience
    is dead, I have failed them \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I have failed everybody.
    \ My last try, my Adam, my golden boy. After years of progress we had made. I
    have failed him, I thought I finally had a cure, that all I had done was worth
    something, and my 4 patients sacrifice was worth something. I administrated the
    test, and at first all his vital signs where in the green, his fever started to
    clear up and the colour was coming back to his face, I finally had my ray of hope,
    then everything dropped to read suddenly to fast for me to stop it. Adams heart
    stop, I now have nothing left, and I am alone once more in this cold dark shell
    of a world.  \u201Clong pause 3 seconds\u201D  The virus has finally taken me,
    I can feel it coursing through my veins at an accelerated rate, too much exposure
    I presume, my own tests have slowed down the rate of the virus, but I have come
    to the conclusion there is no cure, just a delay for you to clear all your debts
    with god and your family, till your sins are reclaimed by the reaper man and your
    time has come.    I guess this is my time to confess my sins, to myself or whoever
    hears this message. My name is Doctor Luke Anderson, I was a doctor at the metro
    university, I fought with my colleagues to help combat this pandemic and find
    a cure. As time went on more and more people became sick, most of my colleagues
    died or fled to be with their families, they lost hope and rather spend what time
    they have left with them, then finding a cure to save every family.    We were
    so close!    We lost funding, even the government lost faith, they said we failed
    to many times to warrant more funding, then spending it more on making people
    comfortable before they die. I argued that we were close, but with the rest of
    my team dead or lost they called me a fool and pushed me to the curb, they all
    lost faith, but I didn\u2019t. I snuck into my old lab and took all the data we
    had collected and 4 of our best patients to a location that I could keep testing
    and fighting this virus, away from distractions.  For the first 2 years I had
    promising results, the world outside was chaos, but in this world of mine was
    harmony and bliss, I was going to soon calm the storm and silence the chaos. Adams
    vitals doing ok he was sleeping, and his time would soon come.  \u201Challucination
    mumbling\u201D  rest little angel you\u2019ll be the angel to save the world,
    with the cure rested on your shoulder. I just wish you could be our saving grace
    sooner, but please just give me time, what time, it has run out for us\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026
    \    I could tell that the patients hated and even feared me, I could hear there
    numbering, only if they knew what I was doing for them. For us all, for Adam.
    But in the 4th year the virus had mutated, and accelerated the symptoms, raising
    the mortality rate to 98% death within 1 week, all my progress was lost and I
    was able to delay their deaths and I tried to make sure there passing was as comfortable
    as I could. They have been using their voice recorders I gave them so they could
    stave off insanity and bring them some comfort. They are all gone now, and with
    Adam, our last savior dead, and my death     I wanted our story to be known, if
    somebody had survived out there and stumbled upon what happened here that you
    would understand why? I went to each room and covered each body and made sure
    they were where given a little dignity, if this is to be there tomb. I left clues
    in each room, through the notes they wrote, a few of the files I had about them,
    and there voice recordings, I don\u2019t dare listen to them, as my heart can
    only take so much, and I know they won\u2019t paint me in a nice light.     I
    hid little clues in each room, that would lead you to a key that would unlock
    each room, and then finally my room, where you are now, at the end of the hall,
    I guess a welcome is in order.  \u201Cmanic giggling\u201D   Once I was done with
    the rooms, I decided to take Adam and place him at the bottom of the hall, with
    the words prophet above his head, so you dear listener would know that he was
    of great importance. I left a note above the lights with the first key and I shut
    off the power.    So now you finally known everything, I hope you don\u2019t judge
    me and my actions, and I hope you was able to see that I was only trying to help,
    and bring a shepherd in to save all us scared sheep from the slaughter of this
    deadly plague. Adam was meant to be your savoir I\u2019m just sorry, you didn\u2019t
    get to see him shine, as I did.    Adam was my greatest achievement, my greatest
    invention, and if he was to know what I did here, for him and the world, I would
    only hope that he was to understand, and doesn\u2019t think of me as a monster.
    \   So now you know my sins, this is going to be my log, as I feel the cold hand
    of death on my shoulder.  "

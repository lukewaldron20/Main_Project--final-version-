  description: Day number I don't know, and i don't care, I have have been here what
    feels like an eternity and i want out of this hell hole. I miss my family and
    friends back in south Africa, I dont even know if the virus has spread that far
    yet, they should be ok they live out in the mountains in a small town. I don't
    even know why i'm writing all this down, whos really going to read this and give
    a crap about what happened to me, all i know is I blacked out and then woke up
    again sometime later, and this pencil and note pad was on the desk, and a tape
    recorder with rolls of film piled beside it. I dont know what the doc wishes me
    to do with these, as theres not going on in my life, just this 10 foot by 12 cell,
    its probably bigger than that but who care for specifics the point is I'm up shits
    creek without a paddle man and I can already tell that im losing it. like come
    on man, what more do you really want from me?    you walk in and inject me and
    leave, you dont even say hi, your not helping my mentle health at all and your
    meant to be a doctor. I call bull on that, I can smell it when you walk in, the
    smell of death and bull, you reek of it, the grim reapers on your shoulder mate,
    and it's just waiting to strike you down, you mark my words.

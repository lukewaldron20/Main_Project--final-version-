  description: Tallyho Watson, finally a pen and paper to jot down our adventures
    and misdeeds against my arch nemesis Doctor James Moriarty. He has evaded me long
    enough, and finally with have him in our grasp, I have managed to disguise myself
    as a book store clerk, as i knew that he is a fan of the written word and that
    he wouldn't be able to resist coming into my place of work. And alas here we are
    my fellow Watson, we are not in his secret layer, we may be trapped in this metal
    box cell, but i have a plan Watson. What is that plan i hear you cry well this
    plan is full proof, and not one that Moriarty will ever see coming. Watson you
    will be my distraction, you will lead his attention towards the desk, while i
    hide by the door, once he comes in, I will smash him over the head with my type
    writer to knock him out, Wait! Oh dam! and blast! i seen to have forgotten my
    type writer no matter my dear Watson, I will just use this pencil instead, it's
    blunt but will do enough trauma to the lower part of his back that he will be
    momentarily staggered, Giving us enough time to make our dashing escape, to find
    detective Lestrade, and to crack this case of the 3 missing people Watson!
